A Randomized Phase I Safety and Immunogenicity Trial of Live Recombinant Canarypox ALVAC HIV vCP205 Delivered by Alternate Mucosal Routes in HIV 1 Uninfected Adult Volunteers,To compare the safety of ALVAC HIV vCP205 to that of ALVAC RG vCP65 rabies glycoprotein delivered by a variety of mucosal routes  To evaluate the antibody  humoral  and cellular  immune responses resulting from ALVAC HIV vCP205   AS PER AMENDMENT 8 3 98  To obtain safety       data on AIDSVAX B B boosting administered by the intramuscular and intranasal routes in the       context of previous immunization via alternate mucosal routes or intramuscularly with a       canarypox vector expressing HIV 1 antigens  vCP205   To obtain immunogenicity data on       AIDSVAX B B boosting   One of the earliest observations in the HIV epidemic was the       demonstration of HIV infection at mucosal surfaces of cells in the genital tract  These data       suggest that priming of immune defenses of viral infected cells may be an important       component in the strategy of developing an effective HIV vaccine  Direct immunization of       relevant mucosal surfaces with a vectored vaccine may stimulate mucosal immunity  The       ALVAC HIV vCP205 immunogen is constructed from a live recombinant canarypox vector that has       a good safety profile in volunteers and should allow mucosal induction of immunity,NCT00000884
A Phase II Trial of Leuprolide   Flutamide   Suramin in Untreated Poor Prognosis Prostate Carcinoma,One current hypothesis as to what limits duration of initial hormone response is the rapid       emergence of hormone resistant prostate carcinoma cells  Suramin has shown effectiveness as       a treatment for hormonally refractory prostate carcinoma  Survival was less in patients with       high rather than low circulating androgen levels  Thus  suramin might slow the emergence of       hormone refractory tumor cells while combined androgen ablation may maximize the       effectiveness of suramin  In this trial  we will pilot this concept,NCT00001266
